## AlbumThing
A project for my CS2300 Databases class. This assists with the downloading of albums
off of YouTube music.


### Running
In the future, running this should be automated more.

First, have npm and yarn installed on your system.
```shell
cd client
yarn install
cd ..
./gradlew app:bootRun  # bootRun will automatically build the client module
```
Navigate to [here](http://localhost:8080)
